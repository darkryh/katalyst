## katalyst-messaging-amqp (in development)

This module is still under active development and is **not** recommended for production workloads yet.  
Interfaces, configuration contracts, and runtime behaviour are subject to change without notice while the team finishes the remaining features and test coverage.  

Feel free to inspect the sources if you are exploring the upcoming AMQP integration, but avoid taking an external dependency until a stable release note explicitly marks the module as supported.
