**Event Domain Models and Contracts**

## Purpose
Pure domain layer for event definitions. Contains:
- Event interfaces and base classes
- Event metadata (tracing, versioning, correlation)
- Handler contracts
- Exception definitions

## No Dependencies
Zero external dependencies - this is the foundational layer.

## Ready for Implementation
See `OPTIMAL_EVENTS_ARCHITECTURE_REDESIGN.md` for detailed specifications.
